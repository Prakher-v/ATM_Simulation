# ATM_Simulation

This Java-based ATM Simulation project is a console application that mimics the core functionalities of a real-world ATM system. It allows users to securely interact with a virtual ATM by setting a PIN and performing essential banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, PIN change, and viewing transaction history.

The program emphasizes security by requiring PIN verification before each sensitive action and ensures a smooth user experience with clear prompts and input validation. All successful transactions are recorded and can be reviewed in the transaction history section, helping simulate a realistic banking environment.

Features:
Set and verify user PIN

Deposit and withdraw cash

View current balance

Change PIN securely

View transaction history

Input validation and error handling

Tech Stack:
Language: Java

Tools: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA

Concepts Used: OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), Scanner class, ArrayList, Conditional logic

Usage:
Ideal for beginners learning Java and core programming concepts. This project serves as a foundational exercise in building interactive, menu-driven applications while implementing real-world logic like PIN-based access and transaction logging.
